# modals-js

modals-js is a straightforward and lightweight solution for implementing modal windows in web applications. With just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, you can add modals to your site that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Overview

This project includes a single modal implementation that can be triggered by multiple buttons. The modal can be closed by clicking on the 'close' button, the overlay area, or by pressing the 'Escape' key for added usability.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML markup for the modal and the buttons that trigger it.
- `style.css`: Provides styling for the modal, overlay, and buttons.
- `script.js`: Contains all the logic to open and close the modal.

## Usage

To see the modal in action:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

To integrate the modal into your project:
1. Copy the HTML markup for the modal and the buttons.
2. Link the `style.css` file in your project or integrate the styles into your existing CSS.
3. Include `script.js` in your project to handle the modal functionality.

## Customization

You can customize the modal's appearance by modifying the `style.css` file. This includes changing colors, sizes, and animations to fit the style of your web application.
